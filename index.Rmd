# Introduction

Students who take the Geoscripting course at Wageningen University are provided an environment in which all the necessary software is preinstalled. If you are one of them, you don't need to read the rest of this page. Those who wish to take the course externally, however, need to set the software up by themselves. This page provides some guidance as to how to do so. It is also useful for students who have finished the course and wish to recreate the software setup on their own hardware.

Having your system properly set-up is a cricial step before starting any geo-processing with R and Python. The figure below provides an overview of some of the different components of the system and how they are connected with each other.

The easiest way to get it all running is to work via a Linux environment. There, all (or almost all) the tools are already preinstalled for you. However, getting it to run takes a bit of practice. There are a few options:

* Running Linux from a virtual machine inside Windows/macOS - easiest but slowest
* Running Linux off of a USB drive (Live system) - best support and ease-of-setup ratio
* Installing Linux on a hard drive (external or internal) - best for long-term Linux use

The [OSGeo Live](http://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html) Linux distribution includes almost everything you need in the course. Alternatively, you can use [Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/), which is more lightweight. We have prepared an [install script](https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/InstallLinuxScript) that installs all the missing tools for the course for both of these options.

It is possible to get all the software running directly on Windows and macOS, but due to the lack of proper package management, we cannot guarantee support; you are on your own. If you are following just one or two lessons, that is fine, since individual lessons require just a small subset of all required software.

# Running Linux

## Linux on a virtual machine

Follow the [instructions on the OSGeo Live website](https://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/virtualization_quickstart.html) to set up VirtualBox and OSGeo Live.

If you want to use Ubuntu 16.04, follow [this guide](https://medium.com/@tushar0618/install-ubuntu-16-04-lts-on-virtual-box-desktop-version-30dc6f1958d0) to set it up manually, or download a premade VirtualBox VDI image of Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit from [OSBoxes](https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/#ubuntu-16-04-vbox) and then follow the [OSGeo Live guide](https://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/virtualization_quickstart.html) to set it up.

For those who wish to set it up on Wageningen PCs, keep in mind that virtualisation needs to be enabled in the PC's UEFI BIOS first.

## Linux on a USB drive

Download the ISO image of either [OSGeo Live](https://live.osgeo.org/en/download.html) or [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/), and write it onto a USB stick. There are several programs to do so depending on your operating system, e.g. [Rufus](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows) on Windows.

This will create a *non-persistent* Live USB. That means that any changes you do will be lost on reboot. If you want to keep your changes, you have two options: 1) Write a persistent Live USB *from within Linux*, or 2) install Linux on external/internal hard drive. A USB stick is also an (extremely slow!) external hard drive.

### Persistent Live USB

To make a persistent Live USB, you need to: 1) have a large enough USB drive (8 GiB minimum, 16 GiB recommended), 2) be booted into Linux. This is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem (only Linux can read and write Linux file systems, and a Linux file system is required to create a persistence file larger than 4 GiB). This point can be solved by either using an existing Linux PC, or by using two USB sticks. An example of the latter follows.

On the small USB stick, create a non-persistent Live USB by following the directions above. Boot into it, connect the large USB stick, open the terminal, and install and run the USB creation tool by running the commands:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mkusb usb-pack-efi
sudo -H mkusb /path/to/iso/filename.iso
```

Choose `i` "Install", `p` "Persistent live", "Use defaults" (or `upefi`, which is the default), select the target device (be *very careful* not to wipe your small USB or an internal disk!), choose the amount of space (100% is fine), select "Go". If the terminal says "Done :-)", then it's finished. If it gives an error, it might still have succeeded.

Reboot, take out the small USB stick, boot from the large one, and you should be good to go.

## Linux on a hard drive

You can also install Linux on an external or internal hard drive. In case of an external one, you get a portable system, but it may be slower than when using a persistent Live USB.

To install Linux onto a hard drive, boot from a Live USB (as detailed above) and double-click on the "Install" icon on the desktop, and follow the setup wizard. Be very careful at the partitioning step to make sure you don't erase something you need! See the [installing Linux on your own hardware](../Intro2Linux/installation.html) page for more details.

## Installing necessary software

Now that you are running Linux, you should run the install script that fetches all the needed software for you. For that, open the terminal and run the following commands:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/InstallLinuxScript.git
cd InstallLinuxScript
cd xenial       ## In case you're running Ubuntu 16.04
cd osgeo-bionic ## In case you're running OSGeo Live 12
bash install.sh
```
