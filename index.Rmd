# Introduction

This page details the easiest ways to set up all the necessary software for taking the Geoscripting course. This is useful to know in the following cases:

- You are following the course externally
- You have followed the course in the past and wish to revisit some of the lessons or want to have all the same software on _your own_ computer
- You'd like to try running Linux on your own device

```{block type="alert alert-success"}
**Note**: regular students taking the Geoscripting course are *already provided* with an environment with all software preinstalled! This environment will be introduced in lesson 4. Thus this guide is only needed for those who want to set an equivalent environment on their own.
```

Having your system properly set-up is a cricial step before starting any geo-processing with R and Python. The figure below provides an overview of some of the different components of the system and how they are connected with each other.

The easiest way to get it all running is to work via a Linux environment. There, all (or almost all) the tools are already preinstalled for you. However, getting it to run takes a bit of practice. There are a few options:

* Running Linux from a virtual machine inside Windows/macOS - easiest but slowest performance
* Running Linux off of a USB drive (Live system) - best support and ease-of-setup ratio
* Installing Linux on a hard drive (external or internal) - best for long-term Linux use

Either way, one needs to choose a distribution. For the course there are two options: 1) the [OSGeo Live](http://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html) Linux distribution is easy to set up and includes almost everything you need in the course, but it's a different environment from the virtual machines that are provided in the course. 2) [Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa](http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) is more lightweight and does not have any of the tools installed, but can be converted to the exact same environment we use during the course. We have prepared an [install script](https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/InstallLinuxScript) that installs all the missing tools for the course for both of these options. **Please don't forget to check the final section of this page about how to use it to install all the needed tools!**

If you are taking the course externally and want to follow just one or two lessons, you can often successfully install the needed software also on Windows and macOS. However, it is more difficult to set it up and thus we do not provide support for such installations: you are on your own for that.

```{block type="alert alert-danger"}
**Warning for students taking the course**: during the course we will **not** support non-standard software stacks, because software setup is a time-consuming, difficult to debug process, and different software versions/platforms often cause unexpected bugs. Thus please **use the provided VDI** introduced in lesson 4, or if that is not available, one of the options described below.
```

# Running Linux

## Linux on a virtual machine

If you prefer OSGeo Live, follow the [instructions on the OSGeo Live website](https://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/virtualization_quickstart.html) to set up VirtualBox and OSGeo Live.

```{block, type="alert alert-info"}
**Note**: If you get screen corruption upon booting to OSGeo Live, press right Ctrl + F1, then right Ctrl + F7.
```

If you want to use Ubuntu 20.04, follow [this guide](https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_virtualbox_2004/) to set it up manually, or download a premade VirtualBox VDI image of Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit from [OSBoxes](https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/#ubuntu-20-04-vbox) and then follow the [OSGeo Live guide](https://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/virtualization_quickstart.html) to set it up.

For those who wish to set it up on Wageningen PCs, keep in mind that virtualisation needs to be enabled in the PC's UEFI BIOS first.

## Linux on a USB drive

Download the ISO image of either [OSGeo Live](https://live.osgeo.org/en/download.html) or [Ubuntu 20.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/), and write it onto a USB stick. There are several programs to do so depending on your operating system, e.g. [Rufus](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows) on Windows.

This will create a *non-persistent* Live USB. That means that any changes you do will be lost on reboot. If you want to keep your changes, you have two options: 1) Write a persistent Live USB *from within Linux*, or 2) *install* Linux on external/internal hard drive.

### Persistent Live USB

To make a persistent Live USB, you need to: 1) have a large enough USB drive (8 GiB minimum, 16 GiB recommended), 2) be booted into Linux. This is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem (only Linux can read and write Linux file systems, and a Linux file system is required to create a persistence file larger than 4 GiB). This point can be solved by either using an existing Linux PC, or by using two USB sticks. An example of the latter follows.

In addition, you need to have the ISO image of the OS you want to install. You can either use a yet another USB stick that holds this ISO, or download the ISO from the web once booted into Linux (provided you have enough RAM to hold it). It's also possible to access an ISO file that you downloaded on Windows, but that requires Windows to be properly shut down (i.e. disable hibernation before shutting down) before booting Linux, or else Linux will refuse to open a Windows file system so as not to damage it.

On a small USB stick (this can be ~4 GiB), create a non-persistent Live USB by following the directions above. Boot into it, connect the large USB stick, open the terminal, and install and run the USB creation tool by running the commands:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mkusb usb-pack-efi
sudo -H mkusb /path/to/iso/filename.iso
```

When the `mkusb` program is launched, choose `d` (dus option). Then option `p` "Persistent live", `upefi`, select the target device, choose the amount of space (100% is fine), select `Go`. If the terminal says `Done :-)`, then it's finished. If it gives an error, it might still have succeeded, as some errors are non-critical.

```{block type="alert alert-danger"}
**Danger**: when you are asked to select the target device, be *very careful* not to wipe your small USB or an internal disk! Make sure that the size matches the size of your large USB drive.
```

Reboot, take out the small USB stick, boot from the large one, and you should be good to go. Any changes you make will be stored and persist between reboots.

## Linux on a hard drive

The methods descrived above make a *Live system*, that is, the contents of the USB drive are mostly stored in memory, which is fast but limits the amount of memory you can use for data processing. You can also *install* Linux, to make it a regular operating system. It can be installed on an internal hard drive, or even an *external* hard drive or a large, fast USB stick. In case of an external drive, you get a portable system that you can boot from any PC, but it may be slower than when using a persistent Live USB. If installed on an internal hard drive, it can live alongside another OS like Windows in a *dual boot* setup.

To install Linux onto a hard drive, boot from a Live USB (as detailed above) and double-click on the "Install" icon on the desktop, and follow the setup wizard.

```{block type="alert alert-danger"}
**Danger**: again, be *very careful* in the partitioning step! If you damage a partition that stores valuable data or another operating system, it will be *permanently lost*!
```

```{block type="alert alert-info"}
**Pro-tip**: See the [installing Linux on your own hardware](../Intro2Linux/installation.html) page for more details.
```

## Installing necessary software

Now that you are running Linux, you should run the install script that fetches all the needed software for you. For that, open the terminal and run the following commands:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/InstallLinuxScript.git
cd InstallLinuxScript
cd focal        ## In case you're running Ubuntu 20.04
cd osgeo-bionic ## In case you're running OSGeo Live 13
bash install.sh
```
